          While there are a lot of mail systems that allow the transmission
          of text and primitive pictures, to send and reply to more complex
          forms is simply not possible.  EEllmm, however, took the forms  mode
          implemented  as part of the AT&T Mail package and has expanded on
          it to be a smoothly fit part of the overall mail system.

          Forms mode gives you the ability to send `template' files to peo-
          ple and receive the filled-in replies.1 Let's look at an  example
          right off.

          Say  we  were going to use computer mail as a way to file defects
          with software.  There is a certain amount of information we  want
          to be able to collect when each report is made, and if it is in a
          specific format we can use programs to file the defects upon  re-
          ceipt.

          The form we'll try to emulate starts out looking like:

          __________
          _1_.  _n_o_t_e  _t_h_a_t  _t_h_i_s _f_e_a_t_u_r_e _a_s_s_u_m_e_s _t_h_a_t _t_h_e _p_e_r_s_o_n _o_n
          _t_h_e _o_t_h_e_r _e_n_d _i_s _a_l_s_o _u_s_i_n_g _t_h_e _E_l_m _m_a_i_l _s_y_s_t_e_m_.

          This  form can actually be created almost exactly as listed above
          in the EEllmm mail system by using your standard editor and can then
          be mailed about as needed.

          Let's say that we want a bit more information, however, especial-
          ly with fields like ``Defect Type'', we want to list all the rec-
          ommended  answers.   To create the actual form, we need merely to
          replace the underlines in the above form with spaces.  The multi-
          line  comments  can  simply  be indicated by a `:' by itself on a
          line;

          As we can see, it is quite simple to create forms!!


          Now that we have an idea what we're talking about, let's actually
          officially define the system...




          May 1, 1990                   Page 2





          Forms Mode Guide                                      Version 2.3



          FFoorrmmss MMooddee SSppeecciiffiiccaattiioonn

          [Note  that  this is all taken from the document _S_t_a_n_d_a_r_d _f_o_r _E_x_-
          _c_h_a_n_g_i_n_g _F_o_r_m_s _o_n _A_T_&_T _M_a_i_l, Version 1.9 of 6/7/86, from AT&T]

          The forms mode is really quite simple.  Simple enough that it  is
          amazing  that  it  hadn't  been implemented before AT&T Mail came
          along!!

          In a nutshell, each field is delimited by a  `:'  followed  by  a
          number  of blank spaces or tabs that represent the valid size for
          that field.  That is, if we have a line in the form like;
               ``Phone (area-code):     Number:          ''
          The area-code field will be limited to three characters  and  the
          number  to  nine.   (this is kind of hard to see with the propor-
          tionally spaced formatted copy, alas).  The only exception to the
          rule is that a `:' by itself on a line represents a field that is
          as large as the user entering the data desires.

          The actual form that is transmitted, in AT&T Mail parlance, is  a
          ``SIMPLE''  forms handler message (as opposed to the ``ADVANCED''
          handler).  This means that it contains three sections;
               _T_h_e _M_e_s_s_a_g_e _H_e_a_d_e_r
               [[OOPPTTIIOONNSS--SSEECCTTIIOONN]]
               ******
               [[FFOORRMMSS--IIMMAAGGEE]]
               ******
               [[RRUULLEESS--SSEECCTTIIOONN]]
          EEllmm generates form messages with the ``options''  section  filled
          out,  but ignores it when receiving mail.  The filled out section
          is:
               WWIIDDTTHH==8800
               TTYYPPEE==SSIIMMPPLLEE
               OOUUTTPPUUTT==TTEEXXTT
          The FORMS-IMAGE section is  that  described  above.   The  RULES-
          SECTION  can  contain explicit rules about the possible values of
          each field, but this is currently ignored by EEllmm, being a  ``SIM-
          PLE'' forms mode mail system.

          Forms also have the header ``Content-Type: mailform'' to indicate
          to the mail system (either EEllmm or AT&T Mail) that a form is being
          sent.

          EEllmm  further indicates that a form has been received by having an
          ``F'' as the status character in the header display section  (in-
          stead of ``N'' for new, etc).

          CCoommppoossiinngg aanndd SSeennddiinngg aa FFoorrmm

          The  first  step to enable sending forms is to change the setting
          of the variable _f_o_r_m_s in your _._e_l_m_/_e_l_m_r_c file to ``ON''.  E.g.:
               forms = ON
          The next step is to send the message to  someone  using  the  `m'
          (_m_a_i_l) command.  This then will drop you into an editor.  Type in


          May 1, 1990                   Page 3





          Forms Mode Guide                                      Version 2.3



          the form as indicated above, with  appropriate  colons  and  com-
          ments, and end the entry by leaving the editor.

          The prompt is now;
         CChhoooossee:: EE))ddiitt mmssgg,, eeddiitt HH))eeaaddeerrss,, MM))aakkee ffoorrmm,, SS))eenndd oorr FF))oorrggeett :: @@
          so  we  choose  `m'  --  _M_a_k_e _f_o_r_m.  The program then will either
          rewrite the prompt without the M)ake form option, indicating that
          the form has been accepted, or will indicate the problem and give
          you a chance to correct it.

          Once it has been accepted, simple use the `s' -- _s_e_n_d  _m_e_s_s_a_g_e  -
          command and it's off!

          _N_o_t_e _t_h_a_t _y_o_u _c_a_n_n_o_t _r_e_p_l_y _t_o _a _m_e_s_s_a_g_e _w_i_t_h _a _F_o_r_m_.

          Let's  reply  to  the  form message we generated now.  The header
          page of the EEllmm mail system will indicate that the message  is  a
          form by having an `F' next to it.  So we use `r' to reply and the
          screen is immediately cleared and we're prompted, field by field,
          for  the data requested.  Each field has underscores in the input
          area to indicate the size field that is expected.

          After answering all the questions we'll have a screen that  looks
          like;

          As was said at the beginning, this way  of  sending  about  forms
          could  prove  to  be very helpful and useful in a variety of con-
          texts.  On the other hand, until a more sophisticated forms  lan-
          guage  is used for the forms, this should be sufficient to embody
          the power of the idea.

          I welcome any comments and thoughts on this system and also  wel-
          come possible enhancements.

          I  also gratefully thank Dale DeJager of AT&T Information Systems
          for sending me more information on AT&T Mail than I could  possi-
          bly digest in any finite amount of time.
