.TH PRINTMAIL 1L "Elm Version 2.3" "USENET Community Trust"
.SH NAME
printmail - format mail in a readable fashion for printing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B printmail
{-p}
{filename}
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Printmail
copies all messages from either the file specified or the
default user mailbox with each message separated by a line of dashes.
With the
.B \-p
option, the messages are separated by a formfeed instead.
.sp
In fact, this command is actually just a slightly differently
formatted call to \fIreadmsg\fR:
.nf
	readmsg {-p} {-f \fIfilename\fR} *
.fi
which does all the work here.
.SH EXAMPLE
A typical usage of this command is;
.nf

	printmail | lpr

.fi
