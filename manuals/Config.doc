               This document is intended as a supplement to the  _E_l_m  _U_s_e_r_s
          _G_u_i_d_e and _E_l_m _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _G_u_i_d_e and should be of interest mainly to
          people at a site either installing or maintaining the source code
          to the EEllmm mail system, or modifying the code.

          It  is  _r_e_q_u_i_r_e_d that installation be done by using the _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e
          script supplied with the system.  Please see  the  file  _I_n_s_t_r_u_c_t
          for further information on running _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e.

          The remainder of this document will discuss the various questions
          asked by the _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e script and the options available  via  di-
          rect  editing  of  various  files  and  parameters.  As indicated
          above, almost all of the sites that install EEllmm should  find  the
          _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e script more than sufficient.

          Elm Configuration Guide                               Version 2.3



          UUssiinngg CCoonnffiigguurree

               _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e  is  a shell script that will automatically deter-
          mine the type of system it is running on and tune the  parameters
          of  Elm  to  fit  that system and its environment.  Where the in-
          staller has a choice, it asks questions of the  installer.   _C_o_n_-
          _f_i_g_u_r_e  provides  its  own instructions when run, so they are not
          repeated here.  However, when the installer is presented  with  a
          choice, this next section explains some of the options available.
          Not all the questions or  options  to  those  questions  are  ex-
          plained.



               Enable calendar feature?

          Elm has a feature to take specially marked lines within mail mes-
          sages and add them to a file for use by the system calendar  pro-
          gram.   The  command to do this extraction needs to be enabled to
          work.  There is also a follow on question regarding the  name  of
          the calendar file:

               Default calendar file?

          which is usually calendar on most systems.  This file will reside
          in the users home directory, not their .elm directory.

               Does your /etc/passwd file keep full  names  in  Berkeley/V7
          format (name first thing after ':' in GCOS field)?

          Elm uses the full name from the password file if it is available.
          There are two major ways this name is stored.   Berkeley/V7  sys-
          tems  place  the name as the entire GCOS field string, that is it
          starts directly after the ':'  that  delimits  the  fields.   USG
          (UNIX(R) Systems Group, or AT&T) systems put the users name after
          a department number and separate it from that number  by  a  '-'.
          The  end  of the users full name in these systems is a '('.  Look
          at your /etc/password file and if either version applies,  answer
          yes  to  that  version.   If neither applies, answer no.  Elm can
          still get the users name from the ".fullname" file in their  home
          directory.

               Every  now  and then someone has a (gethostname, uname) that
          lies about the hostname but can't be fixed for political or  eco-
          nomic  reasons.   Would  you like to pretend (gethostname, uname)
          isn't there and maybe compile in the hostname?

          Elm needs to know the correct name of the host on which it is ex-
          ecuting  to be able to create the proper headers for the outbound
          mail.  Some systems use one name for uucp and  another  name  for
          the  system  and  others just don't reply to the subroutines with

          __________

          May 1, 1990                   Page 2





          Elm Configuration Guide                               Version 2.3



          the proper name.  In this case it will be necessary to compile in
          the  name.   In all other cases this should not be needed.  It is
          provided just in case there is a problem with your system.

               Does your mailer understand INTERNET addresses?

          Elm will work with systems that can process the `@' character  of
          INTERNET format addresses or with the `!' format of uucp address-
          es.  If your mail delivery agent understands the `@'  format  ad-
          dresses,  they  should be used and this question is answered yes.
          If when you send mail with the  `@'  format  addresses  (such  as
          elm@dsi.com), they bounce, then answer this question no.

               Am I going to be running as a setgid program?

          On USG type systems and many other types, access to the mailboxes
          and the mailbox directory is via the group permissions.  The mail
          user  agents,  such as Elm, need write access into this directory
          to be able to move the mailbox around due to internal editing and
          to  create lock files.  If the permissions on your mailbox direc-
          tory are drwxrwxr-x, then Elm needs to be a setgid program.

               What is the default editor on your system?

          If no editor is specified in the users _._e_l_m_/_e_l_m_r_c _f_i_l_e_,  this  is
          which editor to use.  The editor is used to compose outbound mail
          messages.

               What pager do you prefer to use with Elm?

          This is the standard pager to use for reading messages.   Besides
          the usual system pagers, two Elm specific internal options exist:
          builtin and builtin+.  The built-in pager is  faster  to  execute
          but  much  less  flexible than the system provided pagers.  The +
          version just clears the page before  displaying  the  next  page.
          Otherwise the two versions are identical.

          OOtthheerr CCoonnffiigguurraabbllee PPaarraammeetteerrss

               The  following parameters rarely need to be changed, but are
          provided if you need them.  _C_o_n_f_i_g_u_r_e does not prompt  for  their
          values.   To  change  them, edit the _h_d_r_s_/_s_y_s_d_e_f_s_._h file directly
          after running Configure.

          FIND_DELTA
                    This is  the  delta  that  the  binary  search  of  the
                    pathalias  database  will  use  to  determine when it's
                    slicing up a single line, rather than  a  multitude  of
                    lines.    Ideally,  this  should  be set to 1 byte less
                    than the shortest line in the file...the default is  10
                    bytes.

          MAX_IN_WEEDLIST
                    The  maximum number of headers that can be specified in

          Elm Configuration Guide                               Version 2.3



                    the weedout list of the _._e_l_m_/_e_l_m_r_c file.   A  suggested
                    alternative  approach if this number is too small is to
                    specify initial substrings in the file rather than  in-
                    creasing  the  number.   For  example,  say you want to
                    weedout the headers  ``Latitude:''  and  ``Latitudinal-
                    Coords:'',  you  could  simply specify ``Latitud''" and
                    match them both!  Furthermore you  could  also  specify
                    headers  like  ``X-''  and  remove all the user defined
                    headers!

          MAX_HOPS  When replying to a G)roup, this is the  maximum  number
                    of hops that a message can have taken.  This is used to
                    try to optimize the return address (remove cyclic loops
                    and so on) and regular use should show that the default
                    of 35 is plenty more than you'll ever need!

          system_text_file
                    This is the source  text  file  for  the  system  level
                    aliases.   See either the _n_e_w_a_l_i_a_s_(_1_L_) man page, or _T_h_e

                    This is the file that contains the  hashed  version  of
                    the system aliases.

                    This is the other file the _n_e_w_a_l_i_a_s command installs in

                    for  each  of  the aliases contained in the hashed data
                    file.

          ALIAS_TEXT

                    as.  (this feature was added to ensure that users want-

                    write the debug log of the session in question)
