This file describes major changes made to the Elm source distribution
between Releases 2.2 and 2.3.  Please remember that Elm is a volunteer
project, we did what we had time for, and perhaps, what interested us.
If you have a suggestion, or a fix, submit it, and better yet,
volunteer to impliment it.

Complete rewrite of date parsing to allow for RFC822 dates and time zones.

DEL is no longer a syn. for x.

Add BSD style screen sizing when the IOCTL calls exist.

Remove direct access to the L.sys/Systems file and only use uuname.

Add -v option for Elm version and options information.

Allows specifying the temp directory to be used by Elm.

Allow for restricting shell escapes from Elm.  (But of course, not
from any pager or editor Elm would invoke)

Add PID type locking to the lock file.

Make Elm confirm an x command if changes pending, allow X to be the
old non confirming x command.

Allow for disabling the X-Mailer header if desired.

Complete revamp of Configure using new Metaconfig modules.

Add some checking for space problems and force an emergency exit in those
cases.

Allow the alias file to be used across heterogenous networks by
keeping it in network byte order if NFS is available.

Add support for MMDF style mailboxes.

Aliases are now case insensitive as per survey results

Recursive aliases now work again.

And many bug fixes.
